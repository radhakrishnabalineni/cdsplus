DB design for mongo:
	Each content class in cdsplus will become a DB(i.e library content class will be library DB in mongo).
	Each DB (content class) will have 3 collections- metadata(to store meta data xml file), subscriptions(to store all the subscriptions related (filters etc)), content(to store binary files).


DB:library
collections:  metadata,subscriptions,content
